Delivery-Cost-Optimization-Using-Machine-Learning

Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of logistics cost data to identify key trends, address missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The goal is to better understand cost drivers and prepare the dataset for further modeling or optimization.

Project Structure
Importing Libraries:

NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Data Loading:

Imported logistics_cost_data.csv using pandas.read_csv().

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Inspected dataset shape, columns, and data types.

Identified missing values and their counts.

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values in Driver_Hours, Mileage, and Fuel_Used by replacing them with the median.

Planned Improvements:

Future enhancements include advanced missing value imputation techniques and deeper feature engineering.

Requirements
Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Required Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install the necessary libraries using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
How to Run
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Place logistics_cost_data.csv in the same directory.

Open logistics.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.

Execute the cells sequentially.

Future Work
Implement advanced imputation techniques (e.g., KNN imputation).

Build predictive models to forecast logistics costs.

Perform cost optimization recommendations based on findings.
